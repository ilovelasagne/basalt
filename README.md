# basalt
### A cli based lockscreen that is rock solid.
(in beta)
#### Featuring face identification technology!

To install, run this command in a shell: ```sudo curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilovelasagne/basalt/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash```

The command installs most dependencies, however you do of course need curl to fetch the script. You can also just download the install script.
- To install curl on debian run ```sudo apt install curl```
- Or Arch ```sudo pacman -Sy curl```
- Or Fedora ```sudo dnf install curl```
- You've got to do some google detective work for any other distros.

---
If you want to check out the code without installing it, just download the source code.
